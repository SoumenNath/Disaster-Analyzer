# Disaster-Analyzer

This convertToBinary.c program reads in a file of records from the CDD2.csv. This csv file is a database that contains information from natural (and man-made) disasters that have had an impact on Canada since 1900.

The convertToBinary.c file reads in all the data from the csv file and only writes certain parts of that data (the important parts) into a binary file.

The disasterAnalyzer.c file reads the binary file, analyzes the data and outputs several statistics.
